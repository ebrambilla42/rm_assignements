    "#### **General Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, your mission will be to conduct two independent reviews, one for each of the papers whose references are listed below. Both papers are based on a study conducted by the authors and covering two different topics. The goal is, for each of the two studies, to critically analyze the research methodology that was used when planning, conducting, and evaluating the experiments, and finally to formulate an argument about to what extent the study is in line with common standards of research and scientific quality. Each of your review presentations should address the following four questions with reasonable explanations:\n",
    "1. What were the hypotheses?\n",
    "2. Was the experiment design appropriate for the hypotheses?\n",
    "3. Were the analysis and conclusion appropriate?\n",
    "4. General review: Does the paper give a good account of the research conducted? Why (not)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a guideline, the actual review part in each presentation should consist of **roughly 8-10 slides**, although we will particularly pay attention to quality of your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Make sure you use the terminology that was introduced in the lecture and be aware of the fact that there are plenty of examples available on the Internet to help you find your way. And last but not least: Stay objective, no matter which subject the study deals with!_"
