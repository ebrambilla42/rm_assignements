    "* Age\n",
    "* Gender\n",
    "* Professional Status\n",
    "* Smoking Addiction\n",
    "* Bed Linen\n",
    "* Room Temperature\n",
    "* Screen Time  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are considered as independent as changing any of these factors will bring about a change in the most important factor, which in our case is **Sleep**. Varying the independent factors tends to bring about the variation in the dependent factor which for now we consider as **Sleep**. For example, Changing the room temperature from 20&deg;C (Normal Temperature) to 40&deg;C (Hot) or 0&deg;C (Cold) can cause uneasyness and change the sleeping pattern. This can also be explained that some animals go in hibernation in cold weather and come out of hibernation in normal or hot weather.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependent Factors**: These are the factors which get affected or influenced by the manipulation of the independent variables. As mentioned earlier, Sleep is a dependent factor but more than a factor, it is a super-set of factors which actually get affected thus changing this super-set eventually. Thus, Dependent Factors consists of:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Sleep And Health\n",
    "* Overall Fatigue\n",

    "Taking a clue from the previous example, changing the Room Temperature to 0&deg;C can affect the overall health of a person and thus affecting variables like Sleep Hours, Sleep Quality and Overall Fatigue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can also ge argued here that why **Health of an Individual** is a dependent factor and not an independent/extraneous factor because any change in the health changes sleep for that person. But the counter argument can be that the health of the individual is itself a dependent factor on room temperature (atleast in some of the cases). Therefore, even though in one of the cases it is an independent factor but in general it is also dependent. Hence, we consider this as a dependent factor for our study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Extraneous Factors**: These factors are the factors which cannot be controlled. Even after ensuring that the experiment being conducted among different groups is same with no differences and variations, extraneous factors can create certain difference which needs to be taken into consideration while experimenting or atleast not be ignored completely. In our case the following factors are extraneous:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Family Size\n",
    "* Daily Habits\n",
    "* Mental Health (Depressed / Anxious / Scared)\n",
    "* Climate / Weather\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a depressed person tends to sleep more with low activity. On the other hand, a scared person tends to sleep less with low activity but a person in normal state will have a lot of activities and is tend to have a good sleep."

    "6. How often do you exercise in a week?\n",
    "7. How often do you watch the news?\n",

    "**Sleeping:** As described above, this super-set contains the most important differentiating factors which impacts the overall sleep. Factors like **Bed Time**, **Wakeup Time** and overall **Sleeping Hours**. It has the following questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "13. At what time do you usually fall asleep?\n",
    "14. At what time do you usually get up in the morning?\n",

So same questions were asked by the experiment in text, which takes out the voice modulation or facial expression and having same set of questions, gave us a way to follow Double Blinding. Although, since the participants were mostly friends of the researchers/experimenters, some biases could not be avoided, such as having conversation with the participant in-between the interview, or participants asking questions while filling up the survey and so on. Also, since every participant was among the friends/knowns of the experimenters, complete Double Blinding was not possible as some information was always known/available for the subject.  \n",

As a lot of trends have changed over the years, the biggest change has been the **Increase in Working Women Population**. Also, with advances in technology, the **exposure** to things have become more **uniform between Males and Females**. Thus, this could have been a reason of showing no difference at all.  \n",

    "Another possible reason for such data could be the approximation done by the individuals while filling up the questionnaire. As we had no means to accurately track the total sleeping hours, most individuals might have approximated the sleeping hours from 7.5 Hours to 8 Hours or any such figure. This can be assumed to be true as a lot of **participants in the Post-Survey Interview gave the confidence level of 85-90% to their answers**.  \n",

Apart from this, the data has been taken involving people from a specific region and region wise differences cannot be provided through this small data. There are still many difference between the activities being carried out by both the genders throughout the day which have not been taken into consideration here. Also, a major factor which could affect are the hormonal changes, For eg: Pregnancy, Meno-pause and so on.
