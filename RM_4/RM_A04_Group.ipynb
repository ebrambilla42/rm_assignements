        "**Independent Factors**: These are the variables which on manipulating, affects or impacts or brings about a change in some other factors. In our case we have considered the following factors as independent:  \n",

        "* Age\n",

        "These are considered as independent as changing any of these factors will bring about a change in the most important factor, which in our case is **Sleep**. Varying the independent factors tends to bring about the variation in the dependent factor which for now we consider as **Sleep**. For example, Changing the room temperature from 20&deg;C (Normal Temperature) to 40&deg;C (Hot) or 0&deg;C (Cold) can cause uneasyness and change the sleeping pattern. This can also be explained that some animals go in hibernation in cold weather and come out of hibernation in normal or hot weather.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Dependent Factors**: These are the factors which get affected or influenced by the manipulation of the independent variables. As mentioned earlier, Sleep is a dependent factor but more than a factor, it is a super-set of factors which actually get affected thus changing this super-set eventually. This super-set consists of:  \n",

        "\n",
        "It can also ge argued here that why **Health of an Individual** is a dependent factor and not an independent/extraneous factor because any change in the health changes sleep for that person. But the counter argument can be that the health of the individual is itself a dependent factor on room temperature (atleast in some of the cases). Therefore, even though in one of the cases it is an independent factor but in general it is also dependent. Hence, we consider this as a dependent factor for our study.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Extraneous Factors**: These factors are the factors which cannot be controlled. Even after ensuring that the experiment being conducted among different groups is same with no differences and variations, extraneous factors can create certain difference which needs to be taken into consideration while experimenting or atleast not be ignored completely. In our case the following factors are extraneous:  \n",

        "* Family Size\n",
        "* Daily Habits\n",
        "* Mental Health (Depressed / Anxious / Scared)\n",
        "* Climate / Weather\n",
        "\n",
        "As an example, a depressed person tends to sleep more with low activity. On the other hand, a scared person tends to sleep less with low activity but a person in normal state will have a lot of activities and is tend to have a good sleep."
