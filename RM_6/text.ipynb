    "Please answer the questions below. Copy this notebook and enter your answers underneath each task description, inserting cells as needed. You may use a combination of [python 3](https://python3.guide/), [markdown](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html), and [LaTex](https://towardsdatascience.com/write-markdown-latex-in-the-jupyter-notebook-10985edb91fd) to formulate your responses. In order to successfully complete the assignment, you will need the lecture material provided in the [RM moodle course](https://lernen.min.uni-hamburg.de/course/view.php?id=582), especially L10 & L11. **Make sure to use only a copy of this notebook for your answers instead of a new/blank notebook.** \n",

    "Please answer each of the following three questions with step-by-step calculations **and thorough answers/explanations**, using python code and suitable plots. \n",
    "1. Suppose you are a biologist studying a pair of recently discovered species. In your area, 4% of individuals belong to species A and 96% of individuals belong to species B. There is currently no genetic test that is able to distinguish between them. However, they differ in frequency of a rare color pattern. In fact, species A exhibits the rare color pattern in 40% of the cases, while for species B this pattern is found in only 2% of the cases. Assume that these percentages are known with certainty from many years of field research. Now, suppose you find an individual with the rare color pattern.<br><br>Use Bayes Theorem to calculate the probability that this individual belongs to species A.<br><br>\n",
    "2. Let's assume that after graduating from (high) school, 3% of the graduates will study computer science. From numerous surveys, it is commonly known that among all computer science students, 30% play video and computer games for more than three hours per day on average. In contrast, only 6% of students from other disciplines do just that. You are walking across the campus of the University of Hamburg and ask the first student you encounter about the average amount of hours this student spends gaming every day and you receive \"four\" as an answer.<br><br>What is the probability that this student is studying computer science? What is the probability that he/she is taking a different course of study?<br><br>\n",
    "3. You are playing a heated game of Dungeons & Dragons, and the Dungeon Master's (DM) main character always attacks you with two weapons (one dice for each). You would like to know what kind of weapons these are, and you could easily find out if you knew the individual damage rolls, but the DM will only tell you the total sum of both dices. You know that each weapon must be either a d6, d8, d10 or d12 (dX = X-sided dice) and there is no duplicate weapon. You make the hypothesis that the DM is in possession of d6 and d10.<br><br>What is the probability for this hypothesis being valid, considering that the DM's last five attacks had a total damage of [11, 8, 5, 14, 5]?"
